# ft_printf
Project about recoding classic ะก function *printf*

 # Info
 * language - C
 * platform - macOS/Linux/Windows

 # Usage
 There are 2 ways of using this function in your project:
 1. As a standalone library aka *libftprintf.a*
 2. As a part of my another library [*libft*](https://github.com/ltammie/libft)

 If you choose first variant, run:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/ltammie/ft_printf && cd ft_printf && make -s && make clean -s
 ```
     Now you can link libft.a to your projects!

 If you choose second variant, go to [libft project page](https://github.com/ltammie/libft). There are some instructions of how to use it.
